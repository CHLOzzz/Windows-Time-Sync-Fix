# Windows Time Sync Fix
I've noticed a minor yet annoying change happening in Windows computers that sets the `w32time` service to manual **as well as** change the timezone.

This BAT file is meant for those experiencing the same issue in the EST region. If you are not in the EST region, a simple question to ChatGPT and a quick edit in Notepad should be all you need for this to work. I do not plan to add more code to ask the user their timezone.

# Instructions
1. Download *fix_EST_time_sync.bat*.
